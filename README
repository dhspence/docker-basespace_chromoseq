Files Chromoseq.v9.wdl, application.new.conf, and LaunchChromoSeqFromCram.sh are for running locally (LSF) at MGI

Chromoseq_basespace.v9.wdl has all runtime attributes stripped, since the basespace cromwell workflow currently operates on a single node and is not configured to launch each job in a new container (this would waste resources- the current container already has everything each task needs to run)

launch_and_monitor_chromoseq.pl is for launching basespace from MGI

Instructions on running basespace and other information is written in https://confluence.ris.wustl.edu/display/CI/Basespace+SOP

forms & callbacks.js are configuration files from basespace that control the app input parameters and the command line instructions used to launch the app- these must be manually updated
